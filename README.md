# UFOs

## Overview of Analysis
Dana has asked us to create a website to search for UFO sightings. We original created our page iwth a dynamic table and a search button. However, we ended up removing the search button and created filters to search for what we are looking for by different criteria. Now by using our event listener we can run our searches without having to click a button. 

## Results
To use the search you need to type what you are looking for into the search boxes and the event listener will automatically filter the results to what you are looking for.

## Summary
One draw back of this website is that the search can only show one date at a time. 

A recommendation would be to change the search to include being able to search for a range of dates.

Anothe recommendation would be to allow for a looser search. This would allow the user to search for different variations of a city or country (ex. united states, usa, us).
